    <h1>Communication Process Model: Real-World Promotional Campaign Mishaps</h1>
    
    <div class="intro">
        <p>This page presents several real-world examples of promotional campaigns by well-known companies that faced significant backlash. Each scenario involves at least one mistake in the communication process that negatively impacted the campaign's effectiveness.</p>
        <p><strong>Recall the basic steps in the communication process model:</strong></p>
        <ul class="steps">
            <li><strong>Sender (Source):</strong> The company/marketer initiating the message.</li>
            <li><strong>Encoding:</strong> Turning the intended message into symbolic form (words, images, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Message:</strong> The encoded content.</li>
            <li><strong>Channel (Media):</strong> The medium used to deliver the message (e.g., TV ad, social media, catalog).</li>
            <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> How the receiver interprets the message.</li>
            <li><strong>Receiver (Audience):</strong> The targeted customers or public.</li>
            <li><strong>Noise:</strong> Anything that interferes with clear communication (e.g., cultural biases).</li>
            <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The audience's response (e.g., backlash, sales impact).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Task for students:</strong> For each scenario, identify the primary mistake(s) and in which step(s) of the communication process it occurred. Consider how better handling could have prevented the negative outcome.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 1: Pepsi's 2017 "Live for Now" Ad Featuring Kendall Jenner</h2>
        <p>In 2017, Pepsi released a commercial showing model Kendall Jenner leaving a photoshoot to join a peaceful protest. The ad culminates with Jenner handing a can of Pepsi to a police officer, leading to cheers from the crowd as tensions seemingly resolve. The campaign aimed to promote unity but was widely criticized for trivializing serious social justice movements, particularly Black Lives Matter protests. The ad was pulled within days amid intense backlash, and Pepsi issued an apology.</p>
        <p class="question">Question: Where in the communication process did the main mistake occur, and why did it negatively affect the campaign?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 2: H&M's 2018 "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle" Hoodie</h2>
        <p>In 2018, H&M featured a photo on its website of a Black child modeling a green hoodie with the slogan "Coolest Monkey in the Jungle." A similar hoodie with a different slogan was modeled by a white child. The image sparked global outrage for evoking racist stereotypes associating Black people with monkeys. Celebrities cut ties with the brand, stores were vandalized in some regions, and H&M apologized, removing the product and image.</p>
        <p class="question">Question: Where in the communication process did the main mistake occur, and why did it negatively affect the campaign?</p>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 3: Bloomingdale's 2015 Holiday Catalog Ad</h2>
        <p>In its 2015 holiday catalog, Bloomingdale's ran an ad showing a man staring at a laughing woman with the caption: "Spike your best friend's eggnog when they're not looking." The ad was intended as playful holiday humor but was interpreted by many as promoting date rape or non-consensual drink spiking. It quickly went viral on social media with accusations of insensitivity, leading Bloomingdale's to apologize and acknowledge the poor taste.</p>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 4: Dove's 2017 Body Lotion Facebook Ad</h2>
        <p>In 2017, Dove (known for its "Real Beauty" campaign promoting body positivity) posted a short GIF ad on Facebook showing a Black woman removing her brown shirt to reveal a white woman underneath, who then removes her shirt to show another woman. It was meant to demonstrate the lotion suiting all skin types but was accused of implying that Black skin is "dirty" and needs to become white/clean. Dove removed the ad and apologized for missing the mark in representing diversity.</p>
        <p class="question">Question: Where in the communication process did the main mistake occur, and why did it negatively affect the campaign?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="scenario">
        <h2>Scenario 5: Chevrolet Nova in Latin America (1970s)</h2>
        <p>In the 1970s, Chevrolet marketed its car model "Nova" in Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America. The campaign used the same name and messaging as in English-speaking markets. However, "no va" in Spanish means "doesn't go," leading to perceptions that the car was unreliable. Sales suffered, and the example became a classic case of linguistic oversight in international marketing.</p>
