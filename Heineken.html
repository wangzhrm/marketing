        <p><strong>BRUSSELS, Aug 25 (Reuters)</strong> - Dutch brewer Heineken said on Friday it had completed its exit from Russia by selling its operations there to Russia's Arnest Group for a symbolic one euro.</p>

        <p>The world's second-largest brewer said the deal had received all the required approvals and was likely to leave it with exceptional losses of 300 million euros ($324.8 million).</p>

        <p>Heineken announced its intention to exit Russia in March 2022, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, acknowledging that the process had taken longer than expected.</p>

        <p>"Recent developments demonstrate the significant challenges faced by large manufacturing companies in exiting Russia," Chief Executive Dolf van den Brink said in a statement.</p>

        <p>Many multinational companies flocked to leave Russia after the West imposed unprecedented sanctions on Moscow, but the Kremlin has retaliated by seizing some assets.</p>

        <p>Some foreign companies trying to exit Russia are facing a big jump in costs as Moscow is demanding bigger discounts on the price tags of assets they want to sell, three people with knowledge of the matter said.</p>

        <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in July to take control of French yoghurt maker Danone's Russian subsidiary along with beer company Carlsberg's stake in a local brewer.</p>

        <p>Anheuser-Busch InBev has also said it plans to exit its joint venture in Russia with Turkey's Efes.</p>

        <p>Asked if the experiences of Danone and Carlsberg had increased the urgency for Heineken to do a deal, van den Brink told reporters: "Our concern went up but not the urgency. It showed there was a real risk of nationalisation and all you could do was seek to be master of your fate."</p>

        <p>He would not go into details as to why the search for a buyer took longer-than-expected, calling the process "highly complex".</p>

        <p>"We are happy we found a suitable buyer. We believe it is a reliable party...We are happy this process comes to an end and to be able to leave Russia," he added.</p>

        <p>Heineken had seven breweries in Russia and 1,800 employees, who will receive employment guarantees for the next three years.</p>

        <p>The Dutch brewer removed its Heineken brand from Russia last year and production of Amstel is to be phased out within six months.</p>

        <p>Heineken said the deal, with no option to buy the business back, included a three-year licence for some smaller regional brands, for which Heineken would not provide brand support or receive any proceeds.</p>

        <p>Arnest Group owns a major can packaging business and is the largest Russian manufacturer of aerosols, as well as selling cosmetics and household goods.</p>

        <p>Heineken said the transaction will have a negligible impact on its full-year outlook.</p>
