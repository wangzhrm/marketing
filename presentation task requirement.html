        <h1>SunnyBrew Co. Case Study Presentation</h1>

        <h2>Case Context and Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of this engagement is to develop a concise, evidence-based strategy to address <span class="brand">SunnyBrew Co.</span>'s flattening growth trajectory (currently +3%) and escalating competitive pressure within the functional beverage market.</p>
        <p>Your primary task is to present an actionable plan that achieves the CEO's mandate: <strong>a 15% consolidated revenue increase within the next twelve (12) months</strong>.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Length of Presentation:</strong> Around 5 minutes in length, followed by a 3-minute Q&A session.
        </div>

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>While you still need to conduct a market environment analysis in your mind or on your draft, you do not need to show it in your presentation, as we have already completed this task in our mini-report. Instead, this presentation shall start from <strong>market segmentation, targeting, and positioning</strong>.</p>
        <p>Then, you should come up with your <strong>product idea</strong> that may help SunnyBrew achieve its goal. While not mandatory, you are encouraged to incorporate other marketing concepts or models into your presentation.</p>
        <p>You may find that the information contained in the case material is not adequate to support your analysis in your presentation. In that case, you can obtain additional information from publicly available sources or make rational assumptions to support your analysis <em>(you need to cite these public sources or state your assumptions in your presentation)</em>.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>While one student is making the presentation, other students should listen carefully and be prepared to ask questions during the Q&A session. <strong>All students are required to ask at least 2 questions during the Q&A time.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Deliverables</h2>
        <p>While there is no strict requirement for the structure of your presentation, you are still expected to include the following key information:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A <strong>brief analysis of the market environment</strong> (do not waste too much time on this, as we have done this in our mini-report);</li>
            <li>Clearly define the <strong>market segment</strong> you want to focus on (e.g., give it a name and describe the core features of customers belonging to this segment);</li>
            <li>Which <strong>strategy</strong> you will use to reach the target market (<strong>undifferentiated, differentiated, or concentrated</strong>);</li>
            <li>How you want to <strong>position this new product</strong> (come up with two criteria to construct a 2-dimensional map and place your new product into that positioning map). As you may not have enough information about SunnyBrew's competitors, you only need to place your new product on the map you created;</li>
            <li>A <strong>brief introduction</strong> about your product.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As we may not have learned all four aspects of the 4Ps model by the time you make your presentation, it is completely acceptable for your presentation to include information only about the first P of the 4Ps model, which is <strong>“Product”</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>You should submit the following <strong>at least 2 working days before the time slot assigned</strong> for you to make your presentation. Your submission should consist of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>well-designed PowerPoint slide deck</strong>;</li>
            <li>A <strong>speech script</strong> for your speech accompanying your PowerPoint slides in <strong>Word format</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
