                    "They are highly profitable and expanding rapidly.",
                    "They may not generate enough cash to become profitable and require significant investment.",
                    "They already generate more cash than they need.",
                    "They are guaranteed to become 'stars' with more investment."
                ],
                answer: "They may not generate enough cash to become profitable and require significant investment.",
                explanation: "'Question marks' are in a high-growth market but have a low market share. They require a lot of investment to grow and may not always succeed, hence the uncertainty."
            },
            {
                question: "Why do firms invest heavily in products classified as 'stars' in the BCG matrix?",
                options: [
                    "Because they are the easiest products to manage.",
                    "To maintain their market share and capitalize on high growth.",
                    "They are a source of considerable income that can be used elsewhere.",
                    "They are likely to fail without a lot of support."
                ],
                answer: "To maintain their market share and capitalize on high growth.",
                explanation: "'Stars' are products with high market share in high-growth markets. The goal is to invest in them to sustain their position and convert them into 'cash cows' as market growth slows."
            },
            {
                question: "A company that manufactures phones has numerous suppliers for components. This situation most likely leads to:",
                options: [
                    "Suppliers having significant bargaining power.",
                    "High barriers to market entry for new phone manufacturers.",
                    "The phone company having greater bargaining power over its suppliers.",
                    "Low rivalry among competitors."
                ],
                answer: "The phone company having greater bargaining power over its suppliers.",
                explanation: "Having multiple suppliers decreases the bargaining power of any single supplier, as the buyer can easily switch to another. This is an example of a factor in Porter's Five Forces."
            },

                question: "In a SWOT analysis, a company's ability to consistently innovate and launch new products would be classified as a(n):",

                    "Strength"
                ],
                answer: "Strength",
                explanation: "A 'strength' is an internal capability or resource that gives the company a competitive advantage. Innovation is a key strength."
            },
            {
                question: "Some companies focus on niche markets with 'dog' products. Why might this strategy be viable?",
                options: [
                    "They are high-risk products with minimal returns.",
                    "They require significant investment for success in high-growth markets.",
                    "These products can sometimes be revitalized through innovation and better marketing.",
                    "They are easy to acquire and dominate new high-growth markets."
                ],
                answer: "These products can sometimes be revitalized through innovation and better marketing.",
                explanation: "Although 'dogs' have low market share and low growth, a company might find a niche market or apply new techniques to make them profitable again."
            },
            {
                question: "Intense competitive rivalry often results in:",
                options: [

                ],
                answer: "An increase in advertising and promotional spending.",
                explanation: "When companies compete fiercely, they often try to gain market share through aggressive marketing, which includes expensive advertising campaigns."

                ],
                answer: "Long-term plans and courses of action.",
                explanation: "Marketing strategies are the long-term, high-level plans that guide a company's marketing efforts, while 'tactics' are the shorter-term actions to execute those strategies."

                    "To focus on specific product plans and customer groups.",
                    "To set budgets for individual marketing departments.",
                    "To align all marketing efforts with the company's overall mission and goals.",
                    "To evaluate competitors and set product pricing."

                ],
                answer: "Weakness",
                explanation: "A 'weakness' is an internal limitation or a negative factor that can hinder a company's performance. Outdated processes are an internal issue."
